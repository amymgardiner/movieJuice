# movieJuice

Quench your curiosity with a refreshing glass of movieJuice!

This was a group project for a coding bootcamp, created by Bobby Bridges, Amy Gardiner, and Dustin Martin.

Together we came up with the concept, style, and functionality of this application.

## User Story

As a person interested in a movie, I want to easily look up key information about that movie including multiple ratings, so that I can decide whether or not this movie looks like a good pick for me to watch.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am searching for movie information,
WHEN I click on the search bar, I can type in a movie.
THEN when I hit the search bar button, movies matching the title I entered appear on the screen.
GIVEN I have found the movie I was searching for in the list,
THEN I can select that movie and be redirected to a page showing that movie's information.
GIVEN I want to see certain movie information,
THEN the movie's title, image, year, director, genre, stars, and tagline appear at the top of the page.
GIVEN I also want to compare movie ratings from five sources,
THEN the movie's ratings from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, The Movie DB, and Film Affinity appear directly below the movie information.
GIVEN that I want my recent searches saved,
THEN I should see them listed when I go to enter in a movie title in the search bar.
